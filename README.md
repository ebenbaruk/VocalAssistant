# Vocal Assistant

Vocal Assistant is a Python-based voice-controlled personal assistant that allows users to perform simple tasks using voice commands. It demonstrates the use of speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and API integrations.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Time Query**: Ask for the current time.
- **Google Search**: Perform Google searches directly using your voice.
- **Launch Applications**: Open applications installed on your system via voice commands.
- **Stop Command**: Safely exit the assistant using a stop command.
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling for unknown commands or errors.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**:
  - `SpeechRecognition`: For speech-to-text recognition.
  - `pyttsx3`: For text-to-speech synthesis.
  - `pywhatkit`: For Google search and opening applications.
- **Google APIs** (optional): Enhance functionality with Speech-to-Text or other APIs.
